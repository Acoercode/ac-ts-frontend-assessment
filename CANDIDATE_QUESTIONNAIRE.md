# Candidate Notes

This short note is optional but encouraged. Please use it to explain any design decisions, assumptions, or trade-offs you made while completing the exercise.

---

## Tech Choices

- Framework: [e.g., Create React App with TypeScript]
- UI Library: [e.g., Material UI (MUI)]
- State Management: [e.g., React hooks, Context, Redux, etc.]
- Other Tools: [any additional packages you used]

---

## Design Decisions

- [Explain how you structured your components]
- [Explain how you approached API querying & error handling]
- [Note any specific accessibility or responsiveness considerations]

---

## Assumptions / Trade-offs

- [Mention any assumptions about the data, fields, or API behavior]
- [Describe shortcuts you took to fit the exercise into the time frame]
- [Highlight features you intentionally skipped or simplified]

---

## Stretch Goals

- [List which (if any) stretch goals you attempted]
- [Describe your approach to the AI bonus, if applicable]

---

## If I Had More Time

- [What would you add, improve, or refactor?]

---

## Instructions

1. **Fill out each section** with your specific decisions and reasoning
2. **Be honest** about trade-offs and time constraints
3. **Submit this file** along with your code when you're done

## Tips for Good Responses

- **Be specific** about why you chose certain approaches
- **Mention alternatives** you considered but didn't use
- **Explain trade-offs** between different solutions
- **Highlight your thinking process** - we care about how you approach problems
- **Don't worry about perfection** - real-world development involves trade-offs

## What We're Looking For

- **Clear reasoning** behind your technical choices
- **Understanding of trade-offs** and constraints
- **Communication skills** - can you explain your decisions?
- **Problem-solving approach** - how do you think through challenges?
- **Self-awareness** - do you understand the implications of your choices?

*Remember: This is your chance to show us how you think and communicate as a developer. Quality of explanation often matters more than the specific technical choices you made.*
